# Karma Landing Page  

The landing page is the very first challenge I completed in my endeavor to become a full-stack developer.  The challenge was part of our pre-work requirements before starting the coding bootcamp.  After a basic introduction to HTML and CSS, we were given a landing page and asked to duplicate the layout to the best of our abilities using plain, vanilla HTML and CSS - the old fashioned way.  The challenge was completed prior to learning Bootstrap and grid systems.
